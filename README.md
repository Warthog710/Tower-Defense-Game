# Space Force Commander
#### Description:
Space Force Commander is a Tower Defense game written in Java for Android. It features 3 levels of varying difficulty, 3 tower types (plasma, laster, and rocket), and 3 enemy types (each with unique attributes). One of the special features of this game is how the enemies slowly gain resistance to damage from a certain source. This means that the player is discouraged from relying on a single tower type. In brief, the goal of this game is to eliminate all the enemy forces before they reach your base.

#### How To Play:
The gameplay is similar to many tower defense games but with a few twists. The goal of the game is to survive 5 waves of alien cyborgs who are trying to reach the player’s base. If 20 aliens reach the player’s base before the 5 waves are over, then the player loses the game. The player has 3 options for towers to defend their base. They can place a plasma turret for 50 dollars, these have a high rate of fire, but low damage and range. They can place a laser tower for 100 dollars, these are a well rounded tower, dealing medium damage with an average rate of fire. Finally there is the rocket tower for 200 dollars. These deal massive damage and the rockets will track their targets, however this tower fires extremely slowly. Towers can also be upgraded once they are bought. Everytime a tower is upgraded the cost for the next upgrade increases. The cost of the towers and the upgrades force the player to manage their money. The player starts with 100 dollars and can earn more by killing the cyborgs. The stronger the cyborg the more money the player will earn from killing it. The cyborgs come in 3 types. Drones are the weakest and most common of the cyborgs. However, they are fast and can even out-run the rockets. Soldiers are the standard infantry unit. They possess an average health pool and move at a reasonable speed. Then there are the behemoths. These are highly armored cyborgs with huge amounts of health. However, they pay for this with their slow movement. The cyborgs are smart though, every wave they increase their resistance to one of the 3 damage types (plasma, laser, or rockets) based on which one deals the most damage. So, if a player only buys towers of one type they will quickly be overwhelmed by the hyper resistant cyborgs.
